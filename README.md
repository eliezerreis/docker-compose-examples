# Docker Compose Examples
Collection of docker-compose examples for different scenarios. The motivation of this project is to keep tracking of new releases and to document real-world scenarios for a production environment. Feel free to contribute with more scenarios.

# Overview

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. [To install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) follow the instructions and pre-requirements.
